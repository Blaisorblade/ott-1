## To build

### With opam

If you have [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org) installed on your system,
`opam install ott` will install the latest ott version.  The emacs mode
will be in `` `opam config var prefix`/share/ott/emacs ``, documentation in
`` `opam config var prefix`/doc/ott ``.

### Without opam

Ott depends on OCaml version 3.09.1 or later.  It builds with (at
least) OCaml 4.02.3 and 3.12.1.  (Ott cannot be compiled with OCaml
3.08, and it also touched an OCaml bug in 3.10.0 for amd64, fixed in
3.10.1).

The command

  `make world`

builds the ott binary in the `bin/` subdirectory.

This will compiles Ott using `ocamlopt`.  To force it to
compile with `ocamlc` (which may give significantly slower execution
of Ott), do `make world.byt`.


## To run

Ott runs as a command-line tool. Executing bin/ott shows the
usage and options.  To run Ott on the test file
tests/test10.ott, generating LaTeX in test10.tex and
Coq in test10.v, type:

  `bin/ott -i tests/test10.ott -o test10.tex -o test10.v`

Isabelle and HOL can be generated with options `-o test10.thy` and
`-o test10Script.sml` respectively.

The Makefile has various sample targets, `make tests/test10.out`,
`make test7`, etc.  Typically they generate:

filename         | description
---              | ---
`out.tex`        | LaTeX source for a definition
`out.ps`         | the postscript built from that
`out.v`          | Coq source
`outScript.sml`  | HOL source
`out.thy`        | Isabelle source

from files `test10.ott`, `test8.ott`, etc., in `tests/`.

## Emacs mode

The file `emacs/ottmode.el` defines a very simple Emacs mode for syntax
highlighting of Ott source files.  It can be used by, for example,
adding the following to your .emacs, replacing PATH by a path to your
Ott emacs directory.

```ELisp
(setq load-path (cons (expand-file-name "PATH") load-path))
(require 'ottmode)
```
